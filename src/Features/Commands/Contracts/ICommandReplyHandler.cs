/// <summary>
/// Defines a contract for handling and correlating asynchronous responses from a NetMQ Router Socket.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This interface is central to a request-reply pattern. The typical workflow is:
/// 1. A client creates and registers a <see cref="PendingReply{TResult}"/> object using <see cref="RegisterPending"/>.
/// 2. The client sends a request message containing the <see cref="PendingReply{TResult}.CorrelationId"/>.
/// 3. The handler listens for incoming messages on a Router Socket via the <see cref="ReceivedFromRouter"/> method.
/// 4. When a response arrives, the handler uses the message's correlation ID to find the original pending reply.
/// 5. The handler completes the pending reply with the response data, which in turn completes the ValueTask awaited by the client.
/// 6. The <see cref="TryUnregister"/> method is used to clean up pending replies in cases like timeouts or cancellations.
/// </remarks>
